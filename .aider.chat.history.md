#### Write a basic Python stopwatch program that allows the user to start, stop, and reset the timer  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The following files are the ones that will need to be edited or added to satisfy your request:

1. **mini-app/lib/farcaster-embed.ts** – update the app metadata title and description.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file to generate the app logo.  
3. **stopwatch.py** – add a new Python script that implements a basic stopwatch with start, stop, and reset functionality.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks (or new‑file blocks) for them.

I need to add two new files:

1. `stopwatch.py` – a simple Python stopwatch that can start, stop, and reset.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – a description for generating the app logo.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to create those files:

A stylized, modern logo featuring a minimalist stopwatch icon centered on a clean white background. The stopwatch has a sleek silver body with a digital display showing "00:00:00" in a bold, futuristic font. The hands of the stopwatch are slightly extended, indicating motion. The overall design is flat, with subtle shadows to give depth, and the color palette is monochrome with a touch of electric blue accents on the digital display and the stopwatch's frame. The logo should be clear, scalable, and suitable for use as an app icon and splash screen.
